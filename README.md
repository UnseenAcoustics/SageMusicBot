# Questions/Suggestions/Bug Reports
Please read the Suggested/Planned Features List before suggesting a feature. If you'd like to suggest changes to how the bot functions, recommend more customization options, or report bugs, feel free to either open an Issue on this repository, or join my Discord server. (Note: I will not accept any feature requests that will require additional API keys, nor any non-music features). If you like this bot, be sure to add a star to the libraries that make this possible: JDA and lavaplayer.

# Editing
This bot (and the source code here) might not be easy to edit for inexperienced programmers. The main purpose of having the source public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, to allow others to understand how the bot works, and to allow those knowledgeable about java, JDA, and Discord bot development to contribute. There are many requirements and dependencies required to edit and compile it, and there will not be support provided for people looking to make changes on their own. Instead, consider making a feature request (see the above section). If you choose to make edits, please do so in accordance with the Apache 2.0 License.
